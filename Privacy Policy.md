_Last Updated: 11/30/2025

Your privacy is important to us.  
This document explains what information NAP Bot collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.

## 1. Information We Collect

NAP Bot only collects what is necessary for its features.  
No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored.

### 1.1 Automatically Collected Data
The bot may process or store:

- Discord User IDs  
- Guild (server) IDs  
- Channel IDs (for logging or interaction context)  
- Command usage (not stored long-term)  
- Temporary debug logs for error handling  

No usernames, emails, or messages are permanently stored.

### 1.2 Feature-Driven Data
Based on bot usage, we may store:

- Economy balances and statistics  
- Inventory items and crafting progress  
- Mining, streak, and Beast Hunt progress  
- Role IDs for permission systems (e.g., NAP Leader role)  
- Guild-specific settings and configuration  
- Shop item definitions and player transactions  

---

## 2. How We Use Your Data
Data is used solely to provide bot features, including:

- Running the economy system  
- Storing inventory and crafting data  
- Maintaining game progress  
- Enforcing role-based command permissions  
- Supporting server-specific settings  

We **do not** sell, share, or use data for advertising.

---

## 3. Data Storage
Data is stored in **encrypted and isolated SQLite databases**, one per guild.  

### Your data is:
- Never shared across guilds  
- Never sold  
- Never used for tracking  
- Stored only as long as the bot remains in the guild  

---

## 4. Data Removal
Server administrators may request:

- **Full deletion of all guild data**  
- **Deletion of a specific user’s data**  
- **Database resets** 

Data deletion requests will be honored as quickly as reasonably possible.

## 5. Use of Third-Party Services
NAP Bot interacts only with:

- The **Discord API**

Discord’s own Privacy Policy applies to all activity on the platform.

NAP Bot does not use:

- Third-party trackers  
- Advertising services  
- Analytics platforms  
- External data processors  

---

## 6. Security
We use reasonable measures to protect data, including:

- Server-side access controls  
- Minimum-data-storage philosophy  
- Isolation of guild databases  
- No storage of sensitive information or PII  

However, no system is completely secure. By using NAP Bot, you acknowledge this risk.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
NAP Bot follows Discord’s age requirements.  
Users must be **13 or older** (or regional equivalent).

No data is knowingly collected from minors beyond what Discord itself provides.

## 8. Policy Changes
This policy may be updated at any time.  
Continued use of NAP Bot indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
